# Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
..* Flexbox

# What I Have Learned
I was able practise HTML, CSS and Flexbox. More importantly, I have learned that **img** are inline elements and that is the reason I see a white space when **img** is nested inside a container. I also learned that it can be fixed by changing **img** elemtns display value.
